# Kuro UI

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is under development, and, as of currently, relies on other of my projects that are periodically being updated - as a solo dev, managing PRs will be unwieldy as the project grows in the future.

A home-grown collection of pre-built, styleless, accessible, Tailwind friendly components built by [Kuro][kuro].

Amidst the [MyArtverse][mav] redesign in 2022, I had plans to create an internal package called _Biro UI_ -
made a repo on it, but it never panned out, and temporarily canned the project.

## Packages

- [`@kuro-ui/react`](/packages/@kuro-ui-react)
- [`@kuro-ui/svelte`](/packages/@kuro-ui-svelte)
- [`@kuro-ui/wc`](/packages/@kuro-ui-wc) - web component versions built in [Lit](https://lit.dev)

## Setup and Installation
