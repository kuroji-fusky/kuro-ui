# Kuro UI

A home-grown component library built by [Kuro][kuro].

## Packages

- [`@kuro-ui/react`](/packages/react)
- [`@kuro-ui/svelte`](/packages/svelte/)
- [`@kuro-ui/wc`](/packages/web-components/) - web component versions built in [Lit](https://lit.dev)

## Backstory

Amidst the MyArtverse redesign, I had plans to create an internal package called _Biro UI_ -
made a repo on it, but it never pan out and temporarily canned the project.
